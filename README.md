# Daily_Problems_Solving
Regular practice of language makes it better performance.

# Day 01 - Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

# Day 02 - Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

# Day 03 - Shifting Letters II

You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array shifts where shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]. For every i, shift the characters in s from the index starti to the index endi (inclusive) forward if directioni = 1, or shift the characters backward if directioni = 0.
Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Similarly, shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'a' becomes 'z').
Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [[0,1,0],[1,2,1],[0,2,1]]
Output: "ace"
Explanation: Firstly, shift the characters from index 0 to index 1 backward. Now s = "zac".
Secondly, shift the characters from index 1 to index 2 forward. Now s = "zbd".
Finally, shift the characters from index 0 to index 2 forward. Now s = "ace".

Example 2:
Input: s = "dztz", shifts = [[0,0,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: "catz"
Explanation: Firstly, shift the characters from index 0 to index 0 backward. Now s = "cztz".
Finally, shift the characters from index 1 to index 1 forward. Now s = "catz".

# Day 03 - Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]

# Day 04 Find the Median of two sorted arrays

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
